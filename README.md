# fem-digging-into-node
Notes

- JS is well-suited to high throughput / low latency tasks
- Node is well-suited to usage as a "middle end" system to bridge between frontend/backend

- Add `#!/usr/bin/env node` to top of file and make executable so you can run it from cmd line without referencing `node`
